You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

~~~ ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
~~~

Well, that's certainly good to know. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Your shields were failing, sir. This should be interesting. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. They were just sucked into space. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven.

    The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years?

Computer, belay that order. I'll alert the crew. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere!
